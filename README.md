# Hestia
End to End Kafka+DataScience Demo with Druid and Superset

## Fresh install of HDP

- Pre-Reqs
  - Launch a single vanilla Centos/RHEL 7.x VM (e.g. on local VM or openstack or cloud provider of choice) 
  - The VM requires 4 vcpus and ~32 GB RAM once all services are running and you execute a query, so m4.4xlarge size is recommended
